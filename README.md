# Transmission RPC client

A 100% OOP RPC client for Transmission. This library gives you code-completion for all requests and responses available
from the Transmission daemon.

The plan is to keep this in sync at all times with [Transmission RPC specs](https://trac.transmissionbt.com/browser/trunk/extras/rpc-spec.txt). Should you notice
I'm behind on the specs, please notify me by opening a new [issue](https://github.com/kristoftorfs/transmission/issues/new).

__Note that issues are disabled at the moment, as I'm still working on implement the current specs. This should be done somewhere this month (April 2015).__
